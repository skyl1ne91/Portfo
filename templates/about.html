                  <h3>A Bit About Me </h3>
                  <p>Well I cant really say much about me, but just like everyone I have had so many questions in my life. So far I have wandered
                    around trying to piece things together and I found out that I know so little, thankfully I did answer so many questions that I did have, but
                    I know there is so much left to learn.</p>
                  <h3>What I Enjoy </h3>
                  <p>Well I do love doing many things. I enjoy photography, its one of my passions because you are able to capture a moment in life
                  that will remain frozen in time. I also enjoy travelling, FOOD! (obviously), sports, and much more. I don't want to bore you with all my
                  hobbies.
                  <h3>Programming</h3>
                  <p>
                    Oh man, well it's a funny how I started to program, back when Cydia was out for the ipod touch. Yes that's where I started,
                    I wanted to make my ipod custom, so I installed Cydia and unlock the developer tools that in turn allowed me
                    to go into the files I downloaded and adjust them, that's where I learned about JavaScript. The funny thing about this is
                    that I had no idea what programming was at the time, all I knew is that if I change x then y will happen.
                    But that's where it all started for me and from there I kept programming, and it wasn't until I went to UCI for FullStack and then
                    to ZTM for Cybersecurity Expert where it dawned on me that... Why don't I do this for my career???
